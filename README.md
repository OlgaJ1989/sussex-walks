# Sussex Walks

Sussex Walks is a site that provides people with descriptions of walks they can take in and around Brighton (Sussex area). The site targets people who walk or want to start walking long distances and are looking for route ideas. Sussex Walks details some popular routes as well as tips for beginners. 

The website can be accessed [here](https://olgaj1989.github.io/sussex-walks/).

* Landing page image with overlaying page title
    The home.html page (Home) includes a picture of the countryside, with the title of the wesbsite, Sussex Walks, added as overlaying text. The title acts as a centerpiece of the image and catches the eye instantly.

* Popular Walks section
    A section describing four chosen walks with images from along the routes and embedded Google maps for each. The images clearly showcase the landmarks walkers can expect to see and the clickable maps provide the exact route. The design is responsive - users will see 4 columns next to each other on bigger screens and 1 column at a time on smaller devices.

* Interactive footer across all pages
    It consists of clickable icons linking the user to a choice of social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter). All links open in new tabs so the user does not have to leave the Sussex Walks page.

* Gallery
    The Gallery located in gallery.html will provide the user with a collection of photographs showcasing landmarks they will be able to see during their walks. Responsive design of the gallery means the images will still be viewed in a good reolution on a smaller screen.

### Features left to implement

I would like to include another page consisting of a form and called Design Your Walk or similar. The form would consist of a short survey, covering areas such as difficulty, length, and type of a walk. Radio buttons and checkboxes would be provided for the user to be able to make their choices, which they could then submit to the admin to receive personalised walk ideas tailored to their choices.
