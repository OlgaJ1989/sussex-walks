# Sussex Walks

Sussex Walks is a site that provides people with descriptions of walks they can take in and around Brighton (Sussex area). The site targets people who walk or want to start walking long distances and are looking for route ideas. Sussex Walks details some popular routes as well as tips for beginners. 

The website can be accessed [here](https://olgaj1989.github.io/sussex-walks/).

* Landing page image with overlaying page title
    * The home.html page (Home) includes a picture of the countryside, with the title of the wesbsite, Sussex Walks, added as overlaying text. The title acts as a centerpiece of the image and catches the eye instantly.

* Popular Walks section
    * A section describing four chosen walks with images from along the routes and embedded Google maps for each. The images clearly showcase the landmarks walkers can expect to see and the clickable maps provide the exact route. The design is responsive - users will see 4 columns next to each other on bigger screens and 1 column at a time on smaller devices.

* Interactive footer across all pages
    * It consists of clickable icons linking the user to a choice of social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter). All links open in new tabs so the user does not have to leave the Sussex Walks page.

* Gallery
    * The Gallery located in gallery.html will provide the user with a collection of photographs showcasing landmarks they will be able to see during their walks. Responsive design of the gallery means the images will still be viewed in a good reolution on a smaller screen.

    * The contact.html page consists of a form which users can use in order to contact the admin with any questions / queries.

### Features left to implement

I would like to include another page consisting of a form and called Design Your Walk or similar. The form would consist of a short survey, covering areas such as difficulty, length, and type of a walk. Radio buttons and checkboxes would be provided for the user to be able to make their choices, which they could then submit to the admin to receive personalised walk ideas tailored to their choices.

## Testing

* Check the responsiveness of the website on different screen sizes across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera).
    * Test:
        1. Open the website in each of the aforementioned browsers.
        1. Right-click on the screen and choose 'Inspect' ('Inspect element' on Opera).
        1. Grab and drag the responsive window slowly down to 300px and then back again, checking that everything is displayed correctly in each size / breakpoint.
    * Result:
        * All elements are responsive and display correctly in each of the browsers and in each of the window sizes.

* Check that the links in the navigation bar navigate to correct pages. 
    * Test:
        1. Open the website in a browser.
        1. Click on all navigation items (Home, Walking Tips, Gallery, Contact Us) one by one to make sure the attached links are correct and that they lead the user to the correct parts of the website.
    * Result:
        * All links working and directing user to the correct pages.

* Check that the links to social media pages in the Footer work and open in new tabs.
    * Test:
        1. Open the website in a browser.
        1. Click on all social media links (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram) one by one to make sure that the links are in working order and that they all open in a separate tab.
    * Result:
        * All links are working and all of them open in separate / new tabs.

* Check that the name of the page user is currently on is highlighted (underlined) in the navigation bar.
    * Test:
        1. Open the website.
        1. Open each of the pages in the navigation bar to see whether the active page is underlined in the menu.
    * Result:
        * Each of the navigation bar elements becomes underlined when the page is active.
    
* Check that each of the navigation bar elements displays as underlined when hovered over.
    * Test:
        1. Open the website.
        1. Hover over each of the navigation bar elements with the cursor to make sure that they display and underline when hovered over. 
    * Result:
        * Each element becomes udenrlined when hovered over with a mouse cursor.
                
* Check validation of the Contact Us form.
    * Test:
        1. Open the website in a browser and navigate to the Contact Us page.
        1. Fill in the form leaving different input areas empty each time to make sure there is a warning message displayed each time you leave any of the fields empty. 
    * Result: 
        * The form cannot be submitted until each of the input fields has been filled in correctly so the validation is working.

### Validator testing

* HTML - when the code was passed through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html) I have received the following error notification: "Element h3 not allowed as child of element label in this context." referring to all input labels in the Contact Us form. To fix this, I have changed all h3 elements to span elements as per the advice found in [this Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50068995/element-h3-not-allowed-as-child-of-element-label-in-this-context-html). No further errors have been found after I applied this fix and passed the code through the validator again.
* CSS - no errors were found when code was passed through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)
* Accessibility - when using the [Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org) to test the site's accessibility, I received 2 errors:
    * There was not enough contrast between the background and font of the 'Submit' button in the Contact Us form. I have corrected this by changing the background color #559e79 to #32644b. No further errors have been found after I applied this fix and passed the site through the validator again.
    * Two of the aria-labels in the Gallery page were identical. I have corrected this by changing the name of one of them. No further errors have been found after I applied thise fix and passed the site through the validator again.
