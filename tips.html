        <h2>Take it slow, pace yourself and don’t be a hero! <i class="fas fa-walking"></i></h2>
        <p>I know a walk all the way from Brighton to Beachy Head might sound exciting but like everything in life,
            walking requires preparation and at least a little bit of stamina. If you have not walked for a long time
            and you’re not a very active person, make sure you do not start with the wrong route. Pick a short and easy
            route first and then increase the difficulty gradually by choosing different and more demanding walks every
            time. Trust me, those blisters and sore muscles are not worth it!</p>
        <h2>Check the weather but be prepared for anything – we are in the UK after all! <i
                class="fas fa-cloud-sun-rain"></i></h2>
        <p>So the weather forecast has assured you that you are all set for an enjoyable walk in the British sun but
            you ended up walking through a flood? Rookie mistake! First rule of British life is to never trust the
            weather. Make sure you always have a waterproof layer with you to avoid getting a nasty cold.</p>
        <h2>Comfortable shoes are a must! <i class="fas fa-shoe-prints"></i></h2>
        <p>You might have a favourite daily pair of sneakers to go to but please be aware that they might not be the
            best choice of footwear for a walk – especially one in the wild. When planning a long walk through a nature
            reserve of any kind, it’s good to invest in a pair of walking boots as they are more comfortable on long
            distances and provide better support and safety for your feet.</p>
        <h2>Make sure you have supplies <i class="fas fa-tint"></i></h2>
        <p>Water is a must so make sure you are prepared – especially if you are heading into places where shops are
            scarce and you might not be able to grab a bottle. You should drink plenty of water before, during, and
            after the walk. You should also take food to keep up your energy.</p>
        <h2>Remember about aftercare <i class="fas fa-first-aid"></i></h2>
        <p>Make sure you stretch after a walk – trust me, your muscles will thank you for it!</p>
